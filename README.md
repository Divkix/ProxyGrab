I made this software to scrap proxies for my web scrapping and other testing purposes. This program just uses [aiohttp](https://pypi.org/project/aiohttp/) to get the response from API and return the proxies, also it can scrape proxies from a few sites so that it can be used without using the API.

<i><b>NOTE:</b> This library isn't designed for production use. It's advised to use your own proxies or purchase a service which provides an API. These are merely free ones that are retrieved from sites and should only be used for development or testing purposes.</br>
