Asynchronous Library to scrap proxies for my web scrapping applications and other testing purposes. This program just uses [aiohttp](https://pypi.org/project/aiohttp) to get the response from API and return the proxies.

???+ note
    This library isn't designed for production use. It's advised to use your own proxies or purchase a service which provides an API. These are merely free ones that are retrieved from sites and should only be used for development or testing purposes.
