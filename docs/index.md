Software to scrap proxies for my web scrapping and other testing purposes. This program just uses [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests) to get the response from API and return the proxies.

*NOTE: This library isn't designed for production use. It's advised to use your own proxies or purchase a service which provides an API. These are merely free ones that are retrieved from sites and should only be used for development or testing purposes.*

If you havenâ€™t already, check out the [README](https://github.com/SkuzzyxD/ProxyGrab/blob/master/README.md) to get a basic overview for what this tool is about. More advanced topics and use-cases will be covered here. Start by choosing a topic you wish to learn more about from the sidebar.
